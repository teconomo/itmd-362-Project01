1st Project in Stolley's HCI class

My project is a Form that lets users make a quick fitness account. Info that is needed is a <br>

<ul>
  <li>Full Name</li>
  <li>Email as a Username</li>
  <li>Password</li>
  <li>Gender</li>
  <li>Goal</li>
</ul>

The last two are for profile characteristics and info that would be best suited for them.
